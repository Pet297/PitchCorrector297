# CodeName: PitchCorrector297

PitchCorrector297 is a software, that has a singular purpose of correcting any voiced audio samples to the D note. It's intended use is for Sparta Remixes (a meme genre of music) and potentially other music that uses sampling. While "PitchCorrector297" was only a codename, it caught on.

## Project status
This project is considered completed. In the future, a new version that has more functionality might be introduced. The code-base is chaotic, as purpose of this project was to show the correction technique used in the subsequent project, the Sparta Remix Studio.

## Usage guide
1) Clone the repository.
2) Download the needed NuGet package.
3) Build using Visual Studio and run.
4) Follow this YouTube tutorial to use it. Ignore the part about donwloading, (since you built it yourself) and ignore the part starting at 2:03, since it's about a different software and not this one.
